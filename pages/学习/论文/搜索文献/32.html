In a plasma focus device, only 0.02% of the generated ions have more than 1 MeV energy. In this paper, using a new idea we have tried to find a solution to increase the energy of deuterium ions to produce N-13. To achieve this, a series of magnetic lenses has been used to focus and guide the ions. To increase the ion energy, a small linear accelerator has been designed using a TM 010 waveguide. The accelerator waveguide is also designed and optimized to have the highest impedance matching and maximum power transmission.

After 2, 3, and 4 wk of HU, maximal unloaded shortening velocity ( V o ) of single permeabilized semimembranosus muscle fibers was determined by the slack test. Subsequently, the myosin heavy chain and the relative content of MLC were determined by SDS-PAGE. The ratio of MLC 3f to MLC 2f was determined by densitometric analysis.

Generally, a magnetic field has dc and ac components, and it is hard to extract both of these components simultaneously. Conventional Ramsey interferometry can easily measure dc magnetic fields, but it becomes invalid for ac magnetic fields, since the accumulated phase may average to zero. Here, we propose a scheme for simultaneous measurement of dc and ac magnetic fields by combining Ramsey interferometry and rapid periodic pulses. In our scheme, the interrogation stage is divided into two signal-accumulation processes linked by a unitary operation. In the first process, only the dc component contributes to the accumulated phase.

Limited dependence is of a two-limit tobit variety which may, for example, arise as a result of a policy of imposing limits on the movement of the dependent variable by means of marginal as well as intramarginal interventions. We show that when the forcing variables are serially independent the model has an analytical solution which can be computed by backward recursion. With serially correlated forcing variables, we discuss an approximate solution method, as well as a numerically exact method that, in principle, can be implemented by stochastic simulation, although in practice it is limited by available computational ...</div></a><a target="blank" href="/10.1016/s1003-6326(13)62802-2"><div><div></div><div>10:58:24</div></div><div>Strength and fatigue fracture behavior of Al–Zn–Mg–Cu–Zr(–Sn) alloys</div><div><span>Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China</span>, <span>2013</span></div><div>Abstract The strength and fatigue fracture behavior of Al–Zn–Mg–Cu–Zr(–Sn) alloys were studied by performing tensile tests and fatigue crack propagation (FCP) tests.

Therefore, the injection process plays a significant role in the beam performance. Several codes are available to simulate the beam dynamics in the gun.

For all samples the WOM weathering is representative of the different forms of outdoor weathering degradation with an acceleration factor of some units. The QUV weathering is often representative of outdoor weathering with a greater than ten acceleration factor but for a sample which is rapidly outdoor degraded, the QUV chamber results showed that the sample is very resistant to degradation.

In this study, via first-principles calculations, we show that the interaction between oxygen-terminated HfO2 (111) and the MoS2 monolayer is weak and dominated by the van der Waals force. This weak interaction results in symmetric band offsets which are larger than 1 eV. The presence of oxygen vacancies in HfO2 enhances the interfacial interaction significantly, leading to electron–hole puddles, larger effective masses, and localized midgap states in the MoS2. In contrast, strong interaction is found at the interface of hafnium-terminated HfO2 (111) and the MoS2 m...</div></a><a target="blank" href="/10.1097/PRS.0000000000000453"><div><div></div><div>10:58:23</div></div><div>Aesthetic Refinements in the Treatment of Graves Ophthalmopathy</div><div><span>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</span>, <span>2014</span></div><div>In Brief Background: Graves ophthalmopathy is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune disorder characterized by increased volume of intraorbital fat and hypertrophic extraocular muscles.

Rev. E</span>, <span>2012</span></div><div>The dynamics of a symmetric network of oscillators that are mutually coupled via multiple dynamical components with mismatched delays is studied. We find that networked oscillators experience oscillation death (OD) over a much larger domain of parameters when their different dynamical components are linked with mismatched delays than with only one delay. In particular, if the delays are mismatched by retaining a certain bias, OD is proved to be linearly stable even for very large delays for an arbitrary symmetric network. Further, we show that the minimal value of the intrinsic frequency necessary to induce OD decreases as the degree of mismatch in the coupling delays increases. The stabilizing effect of multicomponent coupling with mismatched delays is show...</div></a><a target="blank" href="/10.1073/pnas.88.13.5690"><div><div></div><div>10:58:23</div></div><div>CD4 peptide-protein conjugates, but not recombinant human CD4, bind to recombinant gp120 from the human immunodeficiency virus in the presence of serum from AIDS patients.</div><div><span>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</span>, <span>1991</span></div><div>Sera from human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+; Walter Reed stage 6) individuals inhibit the interaction between recombinant human CD4 and recombinant gp120 from HIV (rCD4 and rgp120, respectively), thereby interfering with the ability of soluble rCD4 to block infection with HIV or rCD4-toxin conjugates to kill HIV-infected cells. In this report we demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of such sera is caused primarily by anti-gp120 antibodies that do not recognize the CD4 interaction site on gp120. To circumvent the problem of inhibition, we have generated a construct containing a peptide of CD4 (residues 41-84) conjugated to ovalbumin (three to five peptides per molecule). This multivalent conjugate binds to rgp120 and binding is not inhibited by ...</div></a><a target="blank" href="/10.1080/00913367.2021.1921633"><div><div></div><div>10:58:22</div></div><div>The Effects of Competence and Warmth Appeals on Luxury and Sustainable Brand Advertising: The Moderating Role of Construal Level</div><div><span>Journal of Advertising</span>, <span>2021</span></div><div>This research examines how warmth and competence advertising can be effectively utilized in luxury and sustainable brand advertising. Across four experimental studies, this research shows diametrically opposite “match-up” effects between advertising appeals and construal levels for luxury and sustainable brands. For a luxury brand, consumers show favorable evaluations when a warmth (competence) appeal is combined with a high (low) construal level. In contrast, for a sustainable brand, consumers show favorable evaluations when a competence (warmth) appeal is combined with a high (low) construal level. Further, these match-up effects are mediated by two distinct mechanisms: brand admiration (a high construal level) and processing fluency (a low construal l...</div></a><a target="blank" href="/10.1073/pnas.1904895116"><div><div></div><div>10:58:22</div></div><div>Identification of a uranium–rhodium triple bond in a heterometallic cluster</div><div><span>Proc.

Biological nitrogen fixation and industrial Haber–Bosch processes for ammonia synthesis are thought to involve multimetallic catalytic sites. Uranium-based materials were used as effective catalysts for ammonia production from nitrogen before an iron-based catalyst was used for the current industrial Haber–Bosch process. However, the synthesis and characterization of multimetallic species with uranium–metal bonds are significantly more challenging and no complex with f -block metal–metal triple bonds have been structurally authenticated by X-ray crystallography thus far.

We conducted a population-based case-control study (145 cases and 405 controls). We used logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Two-way interactions were assessed on both multiplicative and additive scales. Current smoking (OR = 11.6, 95% CI = 6.7-20.1), drinking more than five glasses of alcohol per day (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.2-4.7), and oral infection with High-risk HPV (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.0) were significantly associated with HNS...</div></a><a target="blank" href="/10.1055/s-0040-1714390"><div><div></div><div>10:58:22</div></div><div>Sequential Compression Device Adherence is Low in Hospitalized Antepartum Patients</div><div><span>Am J Perinatol</span>, <span>2020</span></div><div>This study was aimed to describe sequential compression device (SCD) adherence and its associations with SCD education in hospitalized antepartum women.This study included antepartum, nonlaboring women admitted from 2016 to 2018, 1 year before and after an SCD education intervention. SCD use was assessed through the Kendall SCD 700 series compliance meter, which tracks the time the SCD machine takes within the monitoring interval. Recruitment occurred after 60 to 80 hours of monitoring, at which time a patient survey was completed. SCD use was the percentage of time the machine was on during monitoring.

UTD2 is a novel epothilone analog generated by genetic manipulation of the polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster. This study investigated the effects of UTD2 on the actin cytoskeleton and its critical regulators, and the signaling pathways which are essential for cell motility, growth and survival in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Results showed that UTD2 inhibited the cellular functions of actin cytoskeleton, such as wound-closure, migration and invasion, as well as adhesion. Our study further demonstrated that UTD2 suppressed Rac1 GTPase activation and reduced the activity of PAK1, which is a downstream effector of Rac1, while the activity of Cdc42 was not affected. ...</div></a><a target="blank" href="/10.1111/dme.12505"><div><div></div><div>10:58:22</div></div><div>Coffee: friend or foe for diabetes risk?</div><div><span>Diabet.

The non-specific effects of this inflammation were studied in mice concurrently infected with an unrelated parasite, Hymenolepis diminuta, which does not stimulate a visible inflammatory response but is also immunologically rejected by this strain of mice. It was demonstrated that the rejection phase of T. spiralis infection had a marked effect upon the growth and survival of H. diminuta. The cestode either failed to establish or to grow; if the worms were already strobilate when inflammation developed then destrobilation occurred. There was no cross-immunity between the parasites, nor was the interaction a di...</div></a></div></div><div></div>
